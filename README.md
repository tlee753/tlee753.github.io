# Personal Website
One day I decided to develop a website from scratch and after many iterations, here it is...

[tlee753.com](https://tlee753.com)

It's honestly just a hobby/learning experience for me, but it has provided some wonderfully utility throughout the years.

### Layout
I sectioned my site into five main pages:
1. Landing: good summary of the following four subpages, simple catch all with highlights
2. About: just a little bit about me, kind of a random assortment of my likes and interests
3. Portfolio: a few of the personal projects I'm most proud of
4. Blog: some mindless thoughts and wanderings
5. Travel: a travel blog with pictures and maps of the major places I've been to
6. Contact: links to my accounts around the web and social media (fair warning I rarely use social media...)

### Devlopment Information
For those interested, it is a static website that utilizes preprocessing to minimize development time.
