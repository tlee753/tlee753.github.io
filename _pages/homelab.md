After continously running increasingly more powerful servers under my bed throughout the years, I've realized I need to go ahead and take the next step by getting entreprise grade hardware and running everything a little bit more cleanly and powerfully.

### Why have a homelab?
The answer is different for everyone but for me its a mixture of functionality and security. I like having complete control over my files, knowing for certain that only I can see them (unless shared), testing new software solutions for problems, and managing my endless list of project with the best tools available running 24/7.
