The idea behind this project was to make a radio controlled, controllable camera tracking mechanism to follow planes based on their ADS-B radio telemetry (read as GPS location). Initially, I mocked up a acryllic version over the course of a weekend for a hackathon, but eventually decided to improve the project for senior design.
