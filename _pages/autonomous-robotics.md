### Autonomous Robotics

The Institute of Electric and Electrical Engineers helps professional engineers further their careers and
for the next generation, well, begin theirs. Each year the Southeastern conference releases a robotics hardware
competition for those willing to overcome complex challenges. As an active member of the student chapter at
Georgia Tech, I am fortunate enough to work with some of the brightest minds on campus from broad spectrum
of disciplines, and together we scratch build a cargo bot over the course of a year (and an all nighter in a
hotel room in Norfolk, Virginia).

After serving as Mechanical Lead during my 1st year at Tech, I am now serving as president of the hardware team
and consequently on the IEEE executive board at Georgia Tech. This years [competition](http://ewh.ieee.org/reg/3/southeastcon2018/index.html)
features a pirate theme expedition in which the best navigation [software](https://github.com/GaTech-IEEE-Hardware/2018)
will almost certainly win the competition. Therefore, the major focus is on writing precise [PID controllers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller), 
implementing a two methods of localization (quadrature encoders and i2c distance sensor array), and possibly some 
embedded linux PRU communication...
