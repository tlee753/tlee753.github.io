The Electrathon Vehicle Competition was the culmination of three years of engineering classes. The project
is simply to build an electrically powered, single man vehicle which competes against other racers for over an on a
closed track. The complexity of the system was astounding to me as a senior in high school. From wiring a
motor controller to welding the chassis, the project did not reach fruition but I did generate a 70 page brief
on the system along with donating the chassis to kick start the next wave of bright engineers.

I would also like to thank my engineering teacher who modified the scheduling system to allow me to continue
beyond the Fulton County three year engineering pathway.
