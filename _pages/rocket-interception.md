With space fairing payloads being more commonplace then ever before, continuing to diminish the cost per launch is more crtical then ever. In order to prevent loss of valuable rocket components and increase reusability, I've decided to research the idea of intercepting parts before hitting the bottom of the ocean.

This is a fairly involved project as it requires the building of model rockets, quad copters, and potentially high altitude balloons from a hardware standpoint, and some highly advanced control software for autonomous communication and interception. My objective for the project is to launch a model rocket to roughly 1000 feet, deploy a parachute, communicate is location and environment attributes live to a quadcopter, and then be intercepted by said custom built quadcopter(s) during the rocket's decent.

### Rocket Core
The rocket core is the brain of the rocket, specially designed to be as light as possible and separate from  the main rocket body upon charge detonation
