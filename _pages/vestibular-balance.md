This is a simple to use Windows Application that allows old Wii balance boards to be used to aid vestibular patients with their balance. The system provides an incredibly low cost alternative for self monitoring equilibrium.

The program works via creating a Bluetooth connection to the Wii board and using the open source Wii drivers to get the load cell values from the four legs. After some simple math to convert the pressures into coordinates, the center of gravity is plotted in real time for the patient to see. (Vestibular patients often lean left/right without knowing they are unbalanced.)
