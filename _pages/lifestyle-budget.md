Most people budget enough money to get through the next day, week, month, maybe year, but what about lifetime? The idea behind this project is to create a visual aid to guide the filling of "buckets" like "retirement" or "college". After inputing your future plans and expected amount cost of adventures, you can input an income level to see how sustainable that lifestyle is for you.

<br>

Ideally from the views, you can decide which categories you are spending too much on, whether you need to get that raise you've been wanting to afford another kid, and how prepared you really are for retirement.

<br>

The whole thing runs entirely locally so if you wanted to enter real income levels nobody can know. (Code is also opensource so you can check for yourself!)

<br>

The following is my mental mockup of how it would functionally (for someone like me, highly adjustable). This is the monthly view, but a yearly and possibly weekly view will also be available.
