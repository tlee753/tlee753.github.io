This is just a working model of an idea for a easy-to-use timeline of all of history. The backend database for this project is currently under development. The premise is for a region comparable view of the dynasties of history with important events captured overtop these dyntasties. Eventually, I would like to add a map alongside the timeline so that the territorial view of the world can augment the knowledge.
