        <h3>Autonomous Cargo Robot</h3>
        <p>The Institute of Electric and Electrical Engineers helps professional engineers further their careers and
            for the next generation, well, begin theirs. Each year the Southeastern conference releases a robotics hardware
            competition for those willing to overcome complex challenges. As an active member of the student chapter at
            Georgia Tech, I am fortunate enough to work with some of the brightest minds on campus from broad spectrum
            of disciplines, and together we scratch build a cargo bot over the course of a year (and an all nighter in a
            hotel room in Norfolk, Virginia).

            After serving as Mechanical Lead during my 1st year at Tech, I am now serving as president of the hardware team
            and serving on the IEEE executive board at Georgia Tech.
