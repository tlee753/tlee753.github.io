### Rocketry

As an after work project at NASA JSC, the interns are developing a model rocket with an advanced avionics payload. While we didn't quite suceed in all regards, we did have an awesome launch, a successful parachute deployment, and a hell of time making the damn thing.

<br>

The Tiny Flying Rocket (TFR) was modeled after the Saturn 5 and initially intended to be a multi stage, but later reverted to a single stage. It was powered by two F type Estes engines, a 9v battery and custom designed/hand soldered power distribution board, and was run by a raspberry pi zero wireless with accompaniny camera. This is where I spent the majority of my time on the project, the flight avionics and power board, although I thoroughly enjoyed pitching in everywhere.

<br>

The payload didn't end up with design I iterated to nor the functionality I had desired, but I did start the camera over a bluetooth ssh shell to our onboard flight computer and it did capture some interesting footage. Almost immediately after launch our rocket went into a heavy spin as the launch force snapped one of the fins halway off.

<br>

Hope you enjoy the footage and some design pictures.
