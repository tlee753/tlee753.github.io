Just an idea I had while pondering the biggest problems of the world today.
Clean water is hard to come by but vital to our existence, yet we still depend
on the water table and/or active desalinization methods to get the liquid we 
need. Generically, why not create a device cable of converting the salt water
which we have plenty of (judging by the rising oceans) using only the sun's 
energy and a few basic physics principles. Ideally it has minimal upkeep, a 
simple, modular design, and can be mass produced/distributed.

My idea revolves around removing salt via evaporation and several chambers
(still not sure how necessary it would be, will test M.V.P. at some point...)
to separate the water from the salt/impurities. The chambers are stackable thus
allowing the entire design to scaled as required extremely easily. While I will
likely make my model out of a clear plastic to visualize the effects and make 
temperature readings of various locations, the final design will likely be a
black plastic or a hybrid clear plastic/black plastic in conjunction with
external mirrors for maximum heat absorption.
