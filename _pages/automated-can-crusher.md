Managing a team of extremely motivated high schoolers (kidding), I designed and built a fully autonomous can
crushing rig which involved programming a Program Logic Controller (PLC) to perform the correct sequence events.
I first implemented my design using the Autodesk Inventor software program to create a 3D rendition to assist
in working out any kinks before building the prototype. The process involved collecting a can from a gravity
feed stack, moving it to the crushing rig, activating a pneumatic cylinder via a solenoid control valve, and
finally dropping the can onto the diligently placed conveyor belt for removal.

<br>

To follow up, I wrote a design brief, helped develop the alternative designs of other groups, and wrote
a tutorial on operating the PLC for future generations.
