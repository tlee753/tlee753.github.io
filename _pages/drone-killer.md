Due to the dangers posed to aircraft by the swarms of drones in the wild today, a friend suggested a device be build that inhibits a drone's shocking capability of intercepting planes and helicopters. The premise is given a strong enough RF signal, this device would initally alert the drone flyer of nearby aircraft so as to drop alitutude, and given an even stronger RF signal this device would drop the drone as a kill switch does.

So far I've only developed the radio packet transmission aspect as demonstrated by RF "kill packet" transmission, but given more time a PCB with an embedded microcontroller, relay, serial connection, and RF module is in order.
