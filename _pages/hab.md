This is a little scientific experiment I've been meaning to pull off for awhile now. Overall it went well, an altitude near 80,000 feet was reached, my flight planning was dead accurate, and I recovered my payload with a little assistance but I did make my fair share of mistakes for a v1 :). I got a nice little visit from a plane before my cameras cut out...

Launching involved overcoming quite a few of last minute challenges, but fortunately I finally achieved the ascent rate I planned around.

While searching for hours, we did not find the balloon on the launch day due to the GPS landing upside down. As luck would have it, the balloon landed on the property of an extremely kind individual who followed the instructions I had taped to the side. One more long drive later and I had my equipment back.

It was a lot of driving, but I'm glad I got to see some of the more beautiful parts of rural Georgia.
