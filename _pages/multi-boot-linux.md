# Creating a Multi-boot

### Linux system with or without Windows

---

### What?
- A multi-boot (as I've defined it) is any computer that can boot 3 or more operating systems
- A 2 operating system PC is known as a "dual-boot" and is fairly standard as well as simple to do (Google Ubuntu)

### Why?
- Dual-booting (Windows and Linux) is great for maximizing the capabilities of a personal computer as you can run programs built for each operating system without the overhead of a virtual machine
- But sometimes the linux distro you choose isn't always ideal for the diverse range of linux applications

### Use Case
1. I like to run Windows for all the applications that basically require it (CAD, Steam)
2. Ubuntu has been the easiest to use for crypto-mining with wide spread support (drivers) in most linux applications
3. Mint is my favorite operating system which I use as a daily driver and run all my virtual machines (Mac OS) of off
4. Arch is extremely fun to experiment/learn with, I use it for testing desktop environments mostly because the package manager is wonderful
