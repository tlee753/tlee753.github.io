### Interactive Robotics

ROS is a open source framework for all types of robotics projects created by Standford and utilized by
people across the globe. I found out about its particularly useful node based interface via a CS research
class in which I was tasked with voice recognition and response in order to launch a multitude of tasks
involving a camera and robotic arm on a Husky robot.
