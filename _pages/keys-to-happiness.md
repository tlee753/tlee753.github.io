Life is beautiful. I enjoy philosophy and have filled several notebooks and pages upon pages in OneNote with my
thoughts on, well, everything. Its quite amazing how complex yet harmonious life is, and the joy of it all boils
down to five main principles for me. These concepts won't work for everyone (see principle 1) but I have already
started writing a book just to see if I can influence other lives for the better.

- Tolerance
- Appreciation
- Organization
- Kindness
- Being Yourself
