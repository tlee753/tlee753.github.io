        <h3>Windows Server Technical Preview</h3>
        <p>To testout the enterprise grade windows server technical preview and increase my personal coding experience,
            I decided to turn an old Ivy Bridge computer into a server. It allowed me to implement test projects
            remotely while learning about Microsoft's platform.</p>
