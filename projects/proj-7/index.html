        <h3>Cross Platform Stock Monitoring App</h3>
        <p>I have a strong passion for investing and love viewing the rise and falls of the market, however, the
            pre-existing app solutions just weren't cutting it for me so I decided to build my own. Using the Yahoo
            finance API, I am able to store the most recent stock data on my personal server in a predefined format
            to simplify the parsing and API setup for the iOS and Android app.</p>
