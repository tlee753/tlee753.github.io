        <h3>Cross Platform Stock Monitoring App</h3>
        <p>I have a strong passion for investing and love viewing the rise and falls of the market, however, the
            pre-existing app solutions just weren't cutting it for me so I decided to build my own. Using the Yahoo
            finance API, I am able to store the most recent stock data on my personal server in a predefined format
            to simplify the parsing and restful API setup for the iOS and Android app I am building.
        </p>

        <p>
            Due to the simplicity and ease of use, the apps are being configured using the Microsoft Xamarin platform,
            which is a free addition to Visual Studio on Windows or a native, fully-fledged IDE on MacOS. The stock
            data is currently stored in a CSV which is updated every 5 minutes on my server but will soon be pushed to
            a database on my server for future testing (an eventual algorithm building).
