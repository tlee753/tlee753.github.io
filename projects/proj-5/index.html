        <h3>Automated Can Crusher</h3>
        <p>
            Managing a team of extremely motivated high schoolers (kidding), I designed and built a fully autonomous can
            crushing rig which involved programming a Program Logic Controller (PLC) to perform the correct sequence events.
            I first implemented my design using the Autodesk Inventor software program to create a 3D rendition to assist
            in working out any kinks before building the prototype. The process involved collecting a can from a gravity
            feed stack, moving it to the crushing rig, activating a pnuematic cylinder via a solenoid control valve, and
            finally dropping the can onto the diligently placed conveyer belt for removal.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            To follow up, I wrote a design brief, helped develop the alternative designs of other groups, and wrote
            a tutorial on operating the PLC for future generations.
