        <h3>Windows Server Technical Preview</h3>
        <p>
            To test out the enterprise grade windows server technical preview and increase my personal coding experience,
            I decided to turn an old Ivy Bridge computer into a server. It allowed me to implement test projects
            remotely while learning about Microsoft's platform. So far the results have been interesting as remote access
            involves either Team Viewer or tunneling RDP via SSH through an Georgia Tech Server to get around the campus
            firewall.
