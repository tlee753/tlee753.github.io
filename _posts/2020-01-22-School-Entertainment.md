# School Entertainment
School can be pretty boring, sitting behind the concrete walls for hours on end, so a little harmless mischief can really spice things up. Here are a few ideas to entertain yourself.

### Pink and Purple Accounting Report/Site
### Fight Club Powerpoint Slides/Video Inserts
### Lonely Island Musical Number
### Put a Confusing Quote/Lame Joke on the Whiteboard before Class
### Learn Printer IP Addresses and Print Random Stuff
### Teacher Bingo
### Play Pacman on the Calculator
