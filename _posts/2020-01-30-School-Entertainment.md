# School Entertainment
School can be pretty boring, sitting behind the concrete walls for hours on end, so a little harmless mischief can really spice things up. Here are a few ideas to entertain yourself.

### Pink and Purple Theme
Really any kind of hilarious theme that is entirely out of place but can't count against you. I've been a big fan of making everything pink and purple such as this accounting project, but 70's hippie themes or way to much <strong style="color: lime; background: orange;">&nbsp;NEON&nbsp;</strong> are also classics.

### Fight Club Powerpoint Slides/Video Inserts
This might be my all time favorite, and it works on both powerpoints and videos. If you've seen Fight Club, you know there are some random single frame inserts that show Tyler Durden ahead of time. The idea is exactly that, create a powerpoint animation on a picture to automatically appear a few seconds into the slide and then dissapear a moment later. Or a single frame in a video. The look on peoples faces after being subliminally messaged is priceless.

### Lonely Island Musical Number
Everyone loves that teacher that encourages students to "branch out to their creative side" and assigns a project that involves making a song. What better way to entertain the class than picking a Lonely Island number, changing the lyrics, and then signing it with the instrumental playing and the whole class knowing the dirty song behind it.

### Put a Confusing Quote/Lame Joke on the Whiteboard before Class
Definitely did this more in college since the professors are never in the room before class, nothing like having the super high paid professor erasing a groan worthy dad joke before lecture.

### Learn Printer IP Addresses and Print Random Stuff
Useful in high school and rather fun, although stay within reason as your IT department can likely track this stuff. You can usually get the IP address from the printer with a few button presses or by network mapping the school. From there, you just `Add Printer` using the correct drivers and you can either print to the lab printers (didn't cost money when the library did) or print random stuff to the library/other location just to brighten someone's day ;)

### Teacher Bingo
Easy enough, just make bingo cards filled with commonly said words/phrases by the teacher, then watch as the teacher is amazed by how closely everyone is paying attention. Just don't shout Bingo! when you win.

### Play Pacman on the Calculator
The old standby, since most teachers don't let you have a phone out but a calculator is fairly standard in math class. One Youtube tutorial showing how to load the app on and math classes just got way better. Fair warning, fourth level is a pain and you don't want to lose more than one life if you are going for a high score.
