# Cartoons and Comics

Just a quick one until I have time to add more. I was thinking about the beauty of a child's mind and maintaining a sense of wonder. I'd guess cartoons and comics played a big role in the expansion of my imagination - the worlds, comedy, exageration, contradiction, and maybe occasional life lesson. To pay homage to my favorite escapades, I thought I would put a small list together.

### 1. Tom and Jerry

### 2. Calvin and Hobbes

### 3. Pink Panther

### 4. Dr. Suess

### 5. Garfield
