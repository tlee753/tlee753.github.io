# Ranking Star Wars Movies
As a movie enthuisiast and former child, I really love the narrative of Star Wars. I remember watching the originals on VHS for the first time and just being captivated by the world. Lego space ships, Battlefront 2, lightsaber battles for hours in the backyard... the whole thing felt like it just blew out a wall in my mind's imagination.

<br>

In studying movies, I often return to Star Wars as a baseline to engage in exploring the manner in which I'm judging movies and ranking them is thus a side effect. There is also just a lot of nostalgia in rewatching these movies.

### #1 Star Wars (A New Hope)
Controversial top pick for some compared to Empire, but this movie does so unbelievably much that goes under the radar today. To start, it sets up the entire universe: lightsabers, lightspeed, lasers, Vader, Storm Troopers, the Death Star, 

### #2 Empire Strikes Back
Probably the best sequel of all time, mainly because of how it adds to the world we just discovered and expounds on our characters. We know there traits, now they are faced with real conflict. 

### #3 Return of the Jedi
Def fav as a child for the happy ending
Sure  its no death star, but in creating another death star so quickly, it takes away from what made the death star special to begin with

### #4 Revenge of the Sith
Even if you hate the prequels, at the very least appreciate how much ground this movie had to cover. Its the bridge between goodside anakin, the republic being whole, the droids existing, Dooku, the clone wars, the emperor, storm troopers being good, luke and leia being born, and the creation of darth vader.

### #5 Phantom Menace
Looking back i really respect this movie now from a story telling perspetive. It really does have augment the originals with an increible back story and set up more worlds to fill imaginations. The biggest problem is star wars was a story about looking up to adults not being childish.

### #6 Force Awakens
Uhhhh, I had such high hopes for this movie and it just copies the originals too damn much. The nail in the coffin for me is the death star 3.0. Its not kicking a dead horse, its digging it up and then kicking its skeleton. There is no meat there left. There was every oppurtunity in the world to do something different, maybe a small group of sith rise up and reek havoc. But we've done the "two sith and evil empire against rebel alliance" narrative already, those dynamics belong to the originals.

### #7 Attack of the Clones
Parts of it are awesome, the chase on corosaunt, the final battle on genosis, but the dialog and everything else in between just sucks. This movie should be the tales of anakin and obi wan becoming brothers while fighting together and hiding a secret romance with padme.

### #8 Last Jedi
This is definitely the most "frustrating" star wars I've ever watched. Despite the incredible acting, Luke isn't even remotely the same person, the plot is non-sensical, the character interactions are confusing, and the story telling isn't done properly, it doesn't build properly.
