# Galapagos Islands
The crowning jewels of Ecuador (and the natural world at that) are the Galapagos Islands, home to more species than most of the countries of the world combined. For conservation reasons, tourism is extremely limited and it continues to grow more difficult each year to visit the natural reserve, which made me all the happier to have gotten the chance to enjoy the diversity. 

From tropical penguins to the center of volcanoes, our group adventured across the vastly terrain and boated between the many islands. Snorkeling was also incredible, as life underwater is just as astounding as it is above.
