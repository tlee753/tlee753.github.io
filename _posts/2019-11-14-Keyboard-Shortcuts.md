# Keyboard Shortcuts
I think the world of keyboard shortcuts, less time leaving the keyboard is just more efficient. I realized at some point I should compile a list of my favorites so here it goes:

### Chrome / Most Web Browsers / Electron based applications
- `Ctrl + Shift + t` re-opens a closed tab
- `Ctrl + t` opens a new tab
- `Ctrl + l` highlights the url bar for quick url typing/searching
- `Ctrl + w` closes the current tab
- `Ctrl + Tab` cycles through tabs moving to the right
- `Ctrl + Shift + Tab` cycles through tabs moving to the left
- `Ctrl + Shift + R` empty cache and reload
- `Ctrl + Mouse Scroll` zooms in and out of a page quickly

### Linux Terminal
- `Ctrl + l` runs a `clear` without adding anything to your `history`
- `Ctrl + u` clears everything after the cursor
- `Ctrl + k` clears everything before the cursor
- `Ctrl + a` takes you to the beginning of the line
- `Ctrl + e` takes you to the end of the line
- `!!` runs previous command like `sudo !!`

### Vim
- `:G` takes you to the end of the file
- `:gg` takes you to the beginning of the file
- `Y` copies a line and `p` pastes it
- `dd` deletes a line
- `/` searches and `#` cycles through same named terms
