# Keyboard Shortcuts
I think the world of keyboard shortcuts, less time leaving the keyboard is just more efficient. I realized at some point I should compile a list of my favorites so here it goes:

### Chrome / Most Web Browsers / Electron based applications
- `Ctrl + Shift + t` re-opens a closed tab
- `Ctrl + t` opens a new tab
- `Ctrl + l` highlights the url bar for quick url typing/searching
- `Ctrl + w` closes the current tab
- `Ctrl + Tab` cycles through tabs moving to the right
- `Ctrl + Shift + Tab` cycles through tabs moving to the left
- `Ctrl + Shift + r` empty cache and reload
- `Ctrl + Mouse Scroll` zooms in and out of a page quickly

#### Chrome Extensions

I mean, is the internet even usable without an Adblocker?

This isn't a Chrome extension but it sure is wonderful. Network wide adblocking reduces data usage and makes mobile browsing much, much better.
<div class="post-button-back"><a class="button" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh?hl=en-US">Dark Reader</a></div>
The best eye-saver I've found yet. A simple `Alt + Shift + d` and your eye fatigue dips dramatically.
<div class="post-button-back"><a class="button" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en">Vimium</a></div>
If you use `Vim` its a nice little time saver. I mainly love the `j` and `k` scrolling so I don't have to leave the keyboard, `gg` and `G` for top and bottom of the page are also useful.
<div class="post-button-back"><a class="button" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en">JSON View</a></div>
Niche, but if you look at JSONs a lot it really helps visualize and navigate JSONs.

### Linux Terminal
- `Ctrl + l` runs a `clear` without adding anything to your `history`
- `Ctrl + u` clears everything after the cursor
- `Ctrl + k` clears everything before the cursor
- `Ctrl + a` takes you to the beginning of the line
- `Ctrl + e` takes you to the end of the line
- `!!` runs previous command like `sudo !!`

### Vim
- `:G` takes you to the end of the file
- `:gg` takes you to the beginning of the file
- `Y` copies a line and `p` pastes it
- `dd` deletes a line
- `/` searches and `#` cycles through same named terms

### Visual Studio Code
- `Ctrl + Shift + p` to quickly open the command pallete
- ``Ctrl + ` `` to open the integrated terminal
- `Ctrl + Shift + 5` to split the terminal view
- `Alt + z` to toggle world wrap
- Most all `Chrome` shortcuts work here, as VSCode is `Electron` based
