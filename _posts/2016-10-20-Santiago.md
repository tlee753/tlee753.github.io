As a break between Mexico and Ecuador, I flew to Santiago, Chile to meet up with my foreign exchange student from years past. Together we toured the entire capital city, which amazed me at how modern it was. Part of the experience was visiting the newly built skyscraper, Costanera, for a better view of the breath-taking, snow-covered mountains around the city.
