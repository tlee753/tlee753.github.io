# Munich

---

Welcome to the FATHERLAND!!! I've been dying to visit Germany my whole life and all expectations were exceeded. If I had to pick one word to describe Germans it would definitely be efficient. Everyone on the train into Munich had their head down buried in their work; fortunately for me a kind French lady whipped up a conversation which turned into me learning some German.

Munich was buried in roughly 2 feet, or more accurately 6 decimeters of snow when I arrived, but the roads and walkways had been devoid of snow since the army of plows marched by. The churches were by far the biggest surprise
