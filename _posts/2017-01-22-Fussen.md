# Fussen

---

A small town in Southern Germany, Fussen was a winter wonderland if I've ever seen one. There was at least two feet of snow covering everything, an extremely fine snow which swallowed boots whole.
The city is known for its two castles, the second of which was built by a king who romanticized the medieval era.
After exploring the castles, I climbed the foothills of the Alps to catch a stunning panoramic view of the castles, mountains, and city basking in the rainbow sunset.
