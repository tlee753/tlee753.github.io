# Brussels

---

Waffles, waffles, fried food, waffles. I personally found this one to be a bit of a tourist trap but at least it had flavor. Salt and grease to be sure. Aside from a few musuems, the main thing to see is the Parlimentarium, as Brussels is one of the three homes to EU operations. (Strasbourgh and Luxembourg since you are wondering)
