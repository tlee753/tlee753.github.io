- undisputably beautiful city sitting between two diamond green lakes, surronded my mountain ranges
- hiked harder kulm, absolute blast through three feet of snow toward the top
- nutella from hostel and bread from Bern supermarket :)
- quaint city, seperated into two parts
- ice skating rink, people playing in the grassy main area
- paragliding was extremely common although costly
- hiked thorugh woods taking wrong path after bench to get to cable car
- extreme climb through snow to get to cable car, quick walk to over hang
- hostel was awesome, backpaackers hostel, free tokens for hot choclate which was delicious
