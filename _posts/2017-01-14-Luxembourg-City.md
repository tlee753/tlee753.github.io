# Luxembourg City

---

Five minutes after hoping of the train in Luxembourg, I walked into a small cafe to order a crossiant. Upon asking the host if he spoke English, he told me he spoke English, French, German, Spanish, and every other language spoken in Europe. His Spanish checked out and as I walked across the ancient bridge into the fortress that is the city of Luxembourg, I was astonished by how radically different a place it is. My tour book simply said there were some walls and the people enjoyed high end fashion, both of which are true, but it failed to mention that the city served as an almost impenetrable holdout for whichever country was fortunate enough to occupy it. The most immediate feature are the walls built into the cliff, rendering a scaling attack utterly useless.

I was so excited to see Europe I arrived early to catch the sunrise.

There is definitely something magical about European bread. For basically pocket change I got a bagful of pastries to hold me over until dinner.
