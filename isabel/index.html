        <hr>
        <p>
            Will you be my Valentine? <br> <br>
            As much fun as traveling is, it provides a lot of perspective, and helped me appreciate how wonderful
            you've been to me. While I wish I was there for you on this special day, I hope you know I'm smiling on
            the other side of the world knowing I have you. Anyway, eat a box of delicious strawberries on me, and
            enjoy a
            little
            poetry...
        </p>
        <p class="postcard-centered">
            Roses are red, <br>
            Violets are blue, <br>
            Next movie date we <br>
            are watching Saw Two. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            You mean the world to me, keep up the good work and know I am proud no matter what. <br>
            Sincerely,
        </p>
