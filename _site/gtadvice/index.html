    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

    <h5 id="version-31-last-revision-september-2017">Version 3.1 (Last Revision September 2017)</h5>

    <ul>
      <li>First off, congrats on getting into Georgia Tech! It may not mean much know but you have no idea what an accomplishment that is. Clap for yourself.</li>
      <li>This is by no means a comprehensive guide; I only hope it takes some fog of the glasses</li>
      <li>Sorry if I come off arrogant, I predominantly wrote this during my freshman year when I was “somewhat overconfident”</li>
      <li>I’ll try not be, but I am biased. Take all of these opinions with a mountain sized grain of salt, and remember that <strong>a big part of college is figuring things out for yourself</strong></li>
    </ul>

  </div>

  <div class="advice-secondary">

    <h3 id="faset">FASET</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>It is your freshman orientation: a two-day one-night sleepover at Georgia Tech where you get berated with all kinds of information about Tech in boring seminar after boring seminar, powerpoint after powerpoint.
        <ul>
          <li><span class="pro-tip">Pro Tip: Sign up early for the earliest FASET you can, it’s not the end of the world but you get to register for classes before the other freshman, plus it’s nice to get out of the way so you can enjoy your last summer with high school friends<span></span></span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You stay overnight in a dorm overnight with either a random person or you can request to stay with someone you know, who cares</li>
      <li>You are split into groups of about 15 people and assigned a FASET leader who is an upperclassman
        <ul>
          <li><span class="pro-tip">Pro Tip: Get their contact information, I asked mine quite a few questions after FASET was over</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>I wouldn’t make a big deal out of not meeting many people at FASET, they definitely push it on you but you will make lots of friends in college so chill</li>
      <li>There are hundreds upon hundreds of pamphlets and flyers to grab (and free stuff…), pick them up and sort them when you get home into stuff that really matters and stuff that doesn’t (see Clubs for more info)
        <ul>
          <li><span class="pro-tip">Pro Tip: Start putting important things on your electronic calendar which you should already be using in high school (kidding but seriously)</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Half the reason I’m making this guide is because of how rough my FASET was, looking back it wasn’t a big deal</li>

    <h3 id="honors-programs">Honors Programs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>There are two major honors programs at Georgia Tech: Honors College and Grand Challenges. I’m not in either of them so I can only give you an outsider’s perspective. Each has its own community which helps when you are trying to get to know other people</li>
      <li>It’s easy to freak out about this kind of decision before college, but you end up finding your niche regardless</li>
      <li>Honors College is housed on West campus in some of the older dorms. There are special honors classes that you can take as part of the program with far less students, it also sounds good on a resume</li>
      <li>Grand Challenges is a leadership building program with ok reviews. They have their own area on East Campus with a 3D printer and a small event room.</li>
      <li>To me, its similar to joining a sorority or fraternity, is the time you are giving them worth it to YOU? Its worth investigating if you are already interested in their programs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="dorms">Dorms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>East versus West
        <ul>
          <li>Georgia Tech’s freshman dorms are split into East and West with East being smaller/older and West being newer/bigger. Most freshman classes as well as all fraternities are located slightly closer to East campus and the atmosphere is bit more social. I stayed on East so I am biased. However, make this decision for yourself, and base it off your personality. Remember, you are only there for a year, its easy to freak out about everything when you’re a freshman, and I barely spent any time in my dorm anyway.</li>
        </ul>

            <tr>

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </li>
      <li>Both sides of campus have a few crappy dorms to watch out (Smith on East comes to mind).</li>
      <li>West is much quieter, and you won’t be up until 2 listening to Frat house music.</li>
      <li>East is much closer to Atlanta (Piedmont Park, Centennial Olympic Park) and the walk to most freshman classes is much shorter, although you will get some definition in your calves after walking up and down freshman hill for a year. Also, the stadium is on East and the game day atmosphere can be a lot of fun if you are into Georgia Tech football <em>laugh</em>. The best dining hall (North Ave Dining) is on East along with Britain which is where simply-to-go is.</li>
      <li>Best dormitories
        <ul>
          <li>Towers and Glenn (East) were recently renovated and are the probably the best dorms on campus</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Your dorm is unlocked with a key, if you lose that key it’ll cost you $50</li>
      <li><span class="pro-tip">Pro Tip: Get a lanyard and NEVER take it off, otherwise your key will magically evaporate into thin air</span></li>
      <li>You get 3 lockouts (leaving your key in the dorm) before you are charged $50 (different from losing key)</li>
      <li>A mini-fridge is convenient</li>
      <li><span class="pro-tip">Pro Tip: Have one roommate by the fridge outright so you’re not fighting over it at the end of the year. The other person can buy a rug or microwave or something.</span></li>
      <li>There are microwaves in all the dorm lounges, unless you constantly microwave stuff it’s not really necessary, so don’t splurge unnecessarily</li>
      <li>The laundry machines are terrible at Georgia Tech but please, for the love of everyone else, use them. You don’t need quarters either, you’ll use your buzzcard</li>
      <li><span class="pro-tip">Pro Tip: Set the dryer for at least 50-60 minutes</span></li>
      <li>You will be assigned a Peer Leader (Residence Assistant) who gets their own dorm and is supposed to help you get acquainted with Tech. This person is a fantastic resource and worth making friends with (I still go rock climbing with mine…)</li>
    </ul>

  </div>

  <div class="advice-secondary">

    <h3 id="class-registration">Class Registration</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Still one of the most stressful things I do, and it’s much worse your freshman year when you don’t know much more than what some websites and friends have said</li>
      <li>That being said, try and find some upper classmen to help you out ahead of time, and plan your four years out (rough is fine) so you get a better picture of your major (see my template/example)</li>
      <li>You register for your classes on OSCAR (through buzzport) after finding the class numbers you want to take, you’ll will be shown how at FASET</li>
      <li>Here is a the best resource ever for picking classes, try to plan your schedule before going to FASET
        <ul>
          <li>www.courseoff.com/gatech</li>
          <li><span class="pro-tip">Pro Tip: Go on the google chrome web store and download the Georgia Tech course off enhancement app, it adds teacher ratings and previous class grades</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>I recommend 14-16 hours but upperclassmen advice is so useful in knowing which classes have heavy workloads</li>
      <li>Classes with labs are signed up in two parts, the class (usually signified with a letter like K) and the lab (will match class and include number like K07)</li>
      <li>Don’t buy your textbooks unless you are explicitly told you need them, most classes don’t need them, and you can usually figure out if there necessary after the first week of class
        <ul>
          <li><span class="pro-tip">Pro Tip: As is almost always the case, ask an upperclassmen who has taken the course</span></li>

    </ul>

  </div>

  <div class="advice-primary">

    <h3 id="grades">Grades</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Grades are on T-square but they aren’t usually updated regularly, and you will have to calculate your final grade for yourself using syllabus</li>
      <li>At the end of the semester you can check your grade on OSCAR</li>
    </ul>

  </div>

  <div class="advice-secondary">

    <h3 id="organizations">Organizations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>FLO’s aren’t incredibly important, don’t freak out about them, most people don’t join them</li>
      <li>SCPC is the student center program council, they plan a lot of events on/off campus for recreation</li>
      <li>OrgSync is where you will find a list of all the clubs on campus, use it to your advantage before trying clubs/orgs out (which I recommend)</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Recommend a service, professional development, skills, and fun</li>

      <li>Realistically decide on 2-3 to really be a part of.</li>
      <li>Go to a bunch early on but narrow it down based on what you already know about yourself, it’s much better to get heavily involved in a few then barely involved in a bunch</li>

      <li>Football Tickets
        <ul>
          <li>You can either get a season ticket package or try for the free tickets given out online a week before the games. You probably won’t be able to get into the big home games with free tickets though as they go fast.</li>
          <li>Once you’re in the stadium, you can practically sit anywhere except Swarm</li>
          <li>Swarm is the student section, and by far the liveliest part of the stadium but the tickets cost $70 (includes a free t-shirt)</li>
          <li>Helluva Engineer (regular) season tickets are $50</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Laptop
        <ul>
          <li>The classic question, Mac versus PC. I built a PC but my dad let me borrow his Macbook for college so I’m pretty much an expert ;). I would bring whatever you are familiar with, the operating system really doesn’t matter and I haven’t had any compatibility issues with Mac (yes, that includes Matlab) although Macs have occasional problems with the Wi-Fi due to their Broadcom wireless adapter</li>
          <li>The specs I recommend are 13”-15” high resolution screen (1920x1080 is about perfect for size to battery life), 8+ GB RAM, 240+ GB solid state drive, i5 processor or higher, and above all a 6+ hour battery life. Once your battery dies, your day ends and carrying a charger around is a pain</li>

      <li>My Recommended Computer List… MAYBE UPDATE THIS AT SOME POINT</li>
      <li>Don’t bring a printer, there are printers everywhere and you get a free weekly printing allowance of about 55 pages. During week 1 you will install the printing drivers on your computer and then all you need to know is how to swipe your buzzcard at a printing station</li>

    <h3 id="choosing-a-major">Choosing a Major</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Write down the things to matter to you (big picture, i.e. Problem solving, applied mathamatics, coding…) and use that as a guide.</li>
      <li>Look up the major your are interested in online, you can google those classes and the teacher’s websites will come up. Read these sites and check to make sure that makes sense for what you want to do with your life.</li>
    </ul>

    <!--TODO add links to majors/course planners in a table probs -->

    <ul>
      <li>Take this one extremely seriously, it doesn’t define you and you can definitely switch, its just a lot easier/less stressful if you put the work in beforehand.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Find ways to manage your stress
        <ul>
          <li>There are plenty of places to go jogging around campus, it feels great to get away from school once in a while</li>
          <li>Intermurals are a fantastic way to get exercise and meet people</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Bring a rubber mallet to move in day, it makes disassembling the bed frame so much easier</li>
      <li>Get a good foam mattress pad and a liner to keep it from sliding off the bed</li>
      <li>I highly recommend a small plastic filing cabinet with folder/labels, I keep all the stuff I occasionally need neat and tucked away</li>
      <li>Dining Plan
        <ul>
          <li>Go ahead and get the unlimited swipe meal plan, it’s so much easier to not have to keep track of how many swipes you have left</li>
          <li>You will get sick of the dining hall food after a while so try to mix in some other eateries to keep it fresh (dining dollars)</li>
          <li>Simply-to-Go is a once-a-day grab-and-go food program at Britain dining hall, just swipe and pick pre-packaged items, I loved it</li>
          <li>You can use meal swipes at one of the lines in the student center from Monday through Thursday from 4 to 7</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If you do lose your buzzcard or key, don’t get a new one right away, see if you can find it or wait to see if someone turns it in (you’ll get emailed)</li>
    </ul>

  </div>

  <div class="advice-secondary">

    <h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You can instantly reserve a room at the Culc for studying four times a month</li>
      <li>Email can quickly become overwhelming so try to add some filters and stay up to date or you will miss stuff (trust me)</li>
      <li>You do get remote access to fairly powerful computers at Tech but I personally prefer having a decent laptop</li>
    </ul>
